      description: the TO or the MSP can send a message telling that the asset is in use. For simplicity reasons there is only one asset allowed per booking. Technically means this that a booking on MSP side is not equal to a booking on the end user side. The end user should be able to rent 3 bikes in a booking, but this will result in 3 MSP bookings, finally reflecting 3 assets.
